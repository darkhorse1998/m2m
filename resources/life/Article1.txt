What Money Can Actually Buy?
People have a varied range of opinions concerning money. Whilst few of them weighs down on the negative side, others do consider money to
be important. There is also a crowd which is ignorant to this entire concept. Money is usually taken for granted in their minds. They
do not necessarily think like that by choice but due to sheer lack of awarness. In my opinion when the realization dawns on the fact what
money can buy something whose value they can't even comprehend, that's when things would change.
