							<h1 class="major">What Money Can Actually Buy?</h1>
						
							<p>People have a varied range of opinions concerning money. Whilst few of them weighs 
								down on the negative side, others do consider money to be important. There is also
								 a crowd which is ignorant to this entire concept. Money is usually taken for granted 
								 in their minds. They do not necessarily think like that by choice but rather due to 
								 sheer lack of awareness. In my opinion when the realization dawns on the fact what 
								 money can buy something whose value they can't even comprehend, that's when things 
								 would change.
							</p>
							<p>People are usually carefree on their early stages. If I ask someone in their 20s about 
								their retirement planning, they will consider me to be a lunatic or an overthinking-freak.<br><br>
								<i>“Dude! It’s time for me to enjoy life! Why would I bother about retirement? I have decades 
								of time in my hand.” – the usual course of replies.</i><br><br>
								The very thing they can’t comprehend, and which money can buy them is time. They feel that 
								they can always work and keep the flow of money intact. What they miss out is the fact that 
								they are exchanging time for money; time which cannot be purchased back even with money.
								More precisely, they are exchanging time, energy, and skills for money. Unfortunately, all 
								of them are limited.
							</p>

							<p>
								We don’t realize the kind of exchange that goes on, neither do we see the obligations attached to 
								such an exchange. For people who understand the transaction involved the next set of challenge is to 
								grasp the fact that by buying time, money helps one to achieve a state of freedom. It must be kept in 
								mind that money, buying time, is one of the factors that impacts our state of being free. Freedom is 
								indeed quite subjective to individuals; it’s a state of mind. One can argue one that.<br><br>
								<b>But imagine this situation:</b><br>
								<div class="para_outline">
								<i>
									You have a family to feed, your house is mortgaged against a huge loan, you need to pay for your son’s 
									education, your daughter is getting married the next month and you need a huge sum for that, and as a 
									cherry topping you have recently lost your job and are left without an emergency fund.
								</i>
								</div>
								<br> No matter how optimistic, happy-go-lucky person you are, you can’t be free in such a situation. 
								Money doesn’t solve every problem, but it definitely helps. Some people tend to avoid all these money 
								management stuff because they believe it to be very complicated and meaningful only to the rich. 
								Let’s see through a simple example how easy it is to make a financial plan.
								<br /><br />
								Take the following scenario –
								<br /><br />
								<div class="para_outline">
								<i>
									You and your spouse are planning for a child in the next five years. During that period for a term of 
									at least a year you must take care of yourself or your spouse. You want to drop from your job for a year 
									(and you have some arrangements to bounce back after a year). During that period you won’t be getting any 
									salary. How do you manage that situation financially?
								</i>
								</div>
								<br />
								Say, you consider your monthly expenses to be around INR 50,000 after 5 years (let's ignore inflation for this example)<br />
								Total corpus required = INR 50,000 x 12 = INR 6,00,000 = INR 6 Lakhs<br />
								Navigate to any site that helps you calculate the monthly SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) 
								amount against a goal amount within a fixed tenure.
								<br />
							</p>
							<div class="div_align">
							<img src="../../images/sip_goal.png" alt="" class="image_outline"></img>
							</div>
							<p>
								This gives us some numbers to start with. Now, how hard was that? The only thing you needed to 
								get that number was just the details of your plans. If you focus on what we just did, you will understand 
								the significance of this tiny step is tremendous. With this investment in place, you will be able to spend time 
								with your loved ones in probably one of the most prized moments of your life.<br />
								<br />
								This was just a small illustration to show how powerful money can be in life provided you understand 
								what you actually need and use money to buy time in life to create memories; memories to be treasured.
